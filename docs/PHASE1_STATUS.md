# Active Workbench - Current Status

**Updated:** 2026-02-08

## Status

Project is in early assistant-first pivot mode.

Repository state:
- Documentation-only
- Legacy CLI/backend implementation removed
- High-level architecture and priorities defined

## Current Priorities

1. Define tool API contracts (vault, memory, integrations)
2. Stand up secure VPS baseline with Nix/NixOS
3. Integrate OpenCode server runtime with strict tool permissions
4. Deliver first end-to-end YouTube recipe workflow

## Notes

Detailed implementation checklists should be created after tool contracts and security boundaries are finalized.
